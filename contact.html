    <p>Hello! My name is Jiaji Li, an international student from Drexel University. I come from China. My major is entertainment and art management, and digital media concentration. I finished my co-op last year and my task was basically managing official accounts on social media for a company, which helps students to apply for top universities.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am planning to apply for graduate schools in economics. Because I found that it is an interesting topic for me, and it also has a good future. My area is combining digital media and economics. As a digital native, I believe that these two things are playing significant roles in our world.</p>
    <p>I am a big fan of video games. I enjoy playing games and communicating with other players. My favourite game is Dark Soul.</p>
    <p>I love playing piano. I started to practice piano since I was 10. When I was in high school, I created a band with my friends. After that, I turned to play popular music, including some basic composition and piano accompaniment.</p>
